# Contributing to this project

Dear future contributor,

we are pleased that you want to participate in this project. To make our project work as well as possible and to avoid frustration in your and our free time, we would like to ask you to keep a few things in mind:
- Please make sure your code works! 
- Test your code! Our goal is to achieve over 85 percent test coverage....
- Please make sure the code runs as performant as possible and makes sense.
- Please document the code in a way that outsiders (including us) can understand and extend. 
- Please make sure your code is up to date and stays up to date. We would regret it if we had to remove your code after a few months because certain dependencies no longer work or are incompatible with a newer version.
- Don't feel bad if your code is ever not accepted the first time. We really don't mean any harm by this. We just want the best for the project and are happy to have friendly discussions about it and be taught better.

Enough said... Have fun programming. We look forward to your contributions!

Your PrivateHome Team
